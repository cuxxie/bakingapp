This repo is for udacity android fast track project Baking App

This initial version is used to submit to get marked as finished.
While the time used for development is extremely restricted (2x24 hours) to complete, so all the UI and structure is still very messed up.

Will enhance and add additional feature in the near future.

Reason why need to complete in 2x24 hours: 
Contest for scholar who passed all the projects & exam will be raffled to get Google for Indonesia invitation.

Deadline 15 August.
Start working on this: 12 August.


Will update it to Clean Architecture :D maybe within a month
